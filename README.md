## Dependency Injection and Mock
This project is the Swift version of the article [Dependency Injection Demystified](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html) by James Shore. It's a very good introduction of *Dependency Injection*.

Examples in this article are written by Java. I made this small project to transform them into Swift.
